# [What are this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4sXjJJjcWQ)

This is a WordPress widget to display the 5 most recent posts of a given custom post type. There is a link included at the bottom of the widget that links to the archive page of the custom post type.

# How do I install this?

Put the files in your `plugins` directory and then activate the Recent Post Type Posts plugin. Head over to your widget panel and then drag the widget to the widget ready sidebar of your choosing.

# What options do I have?

Right now you can just choose from your custom post types. If you don't have any or don't know what that is, then this plugin isn't going to help you.

# What now?

If you run into any problems just let me know. Feature requests and additional functionality will be taken into consideration.
